# Greyscale Binary Separator: Comprehensive Design Document

## Project Overview

The Greyscale Binary Separator is a system designed to automate a process currently performed semi-manually in Photoshop. The system separates black and white (binary) regions from grayscale regions in document images, applies different processing techniques to each region type, and then combines the results into a final output image.

### Original Requirements

The current manual process involves:
1. Opening images with mixed binary (text, engravings) and grayscale (lithographs, photographs) content
2. Manually selecting grayscale regions
3. Moving selections to a new layer and expanding them by a specified amount
4. Removing the expanded selections from the original layer
5. Applying threshold without dithering to the binary regions
6. Adjusting brightness/contrast and applying threshold with dithering to grayscale regions
7. Merging layers and saving the result

The most challenging aspect is automating the detection of grayscale regions within mixed-content images.

## Design Process

The design process followed a rigorous multi-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Functional Decomposition and Deep Research

In this phase, we decomposed the problem into clear components following the Single Responsibility Principle. We conducted extensive research on techniques for:
- Detecting grayscale regions in mixed-content images
- Analyzing image histograms and textures
- Applying appropriate thresholding and dithering

The research showed that a hybrid approach combining histogram analysis, texture features, and edge detection provides the most robust solution for grayscale region detection.

### Phase 2: Implementation Alternatives Analysis

We analyzed multiple implementation alternatives for each component, considering:
- Performance characteristics
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Extensibility
- Adherence to SOLID principles

For each component, we selected the approach that best balanced these factors, with a focus on creating a system that is both effective and extensible.

### Phase 3: Architecture and Implementation Planning

Based on our analysis, we designed a comprehensive architecture with:
- Clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- Polymorphic interfaces for key components
- Strategic use of GoF design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Facade, Chain of Responsibility, etc.)
- Detailed implementation roadmap

## System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture with two main subsystems:

1. **Region Detection Engine**: Identifies grayscale and binary regions in the input image using a configurable pipeline of detection strategies.

2. **Region Processing Engine**: Applies appropriate processing to each region type and merges the results.

The architecture emphasizes:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Polymorphic interfaces for extensibility
- Factory-based component creation
- Strategy-based algorithm selection
- Pipeline-based processing flow

## Key Components

1. **Detection Strategies**:
   - Histogram Analysis Strategy: Identifies regions based on histogram characteristics
   - Texture Analysis Strategy: Identifies regions based on texture features
   - Edge Detection Strategy: Identifies region boundaries based on edge characteristics

2. **Processing Strategies**:
   - Binary Processing Strategy: Applies threshold without dithering
   - Grayscale Processing Strategy: Applies brightness/contrast adjustments and threshold with dithering

3. **Supporting Components**:
   - Configuration Management
   - User Interface (for optional manual adjustments)
   - Exception Handling

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a phased approach:
1. Foundation Phase: Core interfaces and basic structure
2. Detection Phase: Region detection strategies
3. Processing Phase: Region processing strategies
4. Integration Phase: Combining detection and processing
5. Refinement Phase: Optimization and enhancements

## Integration with Existing System

The Greyscale Binary Separator will integrate with the existing BatchImageProcessor system:
- Implemented as a processor in the processors/image directory
- Registered with the ImageProcessorFactory
- Configured via YAML files
- Compatible with the existing pipeline architecture

## Conclusion

The Greyscale Binary Separator design provides a robust, flexible, and maintainable solution to the challenge of automatically detecting and separately processing grayscale and binary regions in mixed-content document images. By applying sound software engineering principles and appropriate design patterns, the system will deliver the required functionality while remaining extensible for future enhancements.
