Act as a senior staff engineer with deep expertise in software architecture tasked with producing a comprehensive and technically rigorous Design Document for implementing the following requirements:

I am trying to essentially automate a process that is currently semi-automated using photoshop, allow me to lay out the exact process:

* I open up 10 images of a book at a time in photoshop. the images have a mixture of black and white material (text, engravings, etc) and greyscale material (lithographs, photographs, etc). 
* The main requirement of the task is to separate the black and white part from the greyscale parts somehow such that the end result is the black and white (binary) parts of the image are thresholded without dithering, and that the greyscale parts of the image are thresholded with dithering (at a specified dpi)
* The way I do this in photoshop is to create a selection of the greyscale image, normally directly at the exact edge of the greyscale graphic, either using a box or some ofhter kind of selector, since it may be curved graphic.
* Then I cut the selection (or multiple selections if there are multiple parts withe greyscale) into a new layer 
* Then I expand the selection by a specified pixel amount, set by the user
* Then I go back to the original layer and delete the selection (since we expanded the selection this makes it remove any part of the graphic that was left out, so we are cleaning it up so the border is not thresholded with the binary image.
* Then we threshold the binary image with a specified value
* Then we go back to the greyscale layer and mess with the brightness/contrast with a specified value (or auto)
* Then we threshold the greyscale image with dithering and a specified dpi and dithering type
* Then we merge everything and save the image as a bitmap
* That is the end of the task


The part i am the most worried about is being able to detect the selection of the greyscale part of the image. 

I need you to do some deep research with brave search to find information on the best way to do this with modern techniques, so I can see how I should do this.

Use a recursive, multi-phase workflow to ensure completeness, technical depth, and accuracy. Apply best practices from software engineering, including SOLID principles (especially Single Responsibility Principle) and appropriate Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns.

Leverage the Brave Search MCP (already installed) for deep research:
- Read Wikipedia pages for "Single Responsibility Principle" and "GoF design patterns"
- Research academic papers and technical literature
- Study industry best practices and architectural patterns
- Explore comprehensive API documentation
- Analyze exemplary open-source implementations
- Evaluate technical blogs and case studies
- Review performance benchmarks and scalability analyses
- Identify appropriate design patterns for each component
- Explore polymorphic interface designs and abstraction models

IMPORTANT:
1. Apply a recursive decomposition approach - break down complex components into sub-components, and recursively research and analyze each
2. For each component, identify opportunities to apply polymorphism to enhance flexibility and extensibility
3. Consider at least 3 different GoF design patterns for each major component
4. Read and apply principles from the Single Responsibility Principle
5. Document your deep research process and findings at each step
6. Provide justification for all architectural decisions based on research

Use search results to inform and enhance every aspect of your design. Your final design document should demonstrate exceptional depth of research, technical rigor, and architectural excellence.
