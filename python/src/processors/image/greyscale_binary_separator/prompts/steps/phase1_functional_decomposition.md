# Phase 1: Functional Decomposition and Deep Research

## Initial Decomposition
- [x] Decompose the prompts/requirements.md into clear modules or components following the Single Responsibility Principle.
- [x] Identify system boundaries, responsibilities, and data flows.
- [x] Create a component dependency graph showing relationships between components.
- [x] Add a markdown file in prompts/components/ directory with an explanation of each component.

## Deep Research Process (Recursive)
- [x] For each identified component:
  - [x] Use Brave Search MCP to research "best practices for [component/problem]"
  - [x] Research "design patterns for [component/problem]"
  - [x] Read the Wikipedia page for "Single Responsibility Principle" using Brave Search MCP
  - [x] Read the Wikipedia page for "GoF design patterns" using Brave Search MCP
  - [x] Identify potential polymorphic interfaces that could enhance flexibility
  - [x] Further decompose each component into sub-components if complexity warrants it
  - [x] Recursively apply this deep research process to each sub-component
  - [x] Document findings in the component's markdown file

## Knowledge Integration
- [x] Integrate research findings to refine the component structure
- [x] Identify opportunities to apply appropriate design patterns (GoF patterns)
- [x] Document how polymorphism can be applied to enhance extensibility
- [x] Update component documentation to reflect deep research insights

## Complete Files
- [x] `grayscale_detection_research.md`: Research on techniques for detecting grayscale regions in images
- [x] `functional_decomposition.md`: Complete system decomposition with component descriptions and relationships
- [x] `design_principles_research.md`: Research on SRP and GoF design patterns with application to our system

(For each component, extensive research was conducted using Brave Search with queries like: "image processing techniques for detecting grayscale regions", "techniques to detect and separate text from images", "image segmentation techniques", etc. All significant findings were documented in the respective component files.)
