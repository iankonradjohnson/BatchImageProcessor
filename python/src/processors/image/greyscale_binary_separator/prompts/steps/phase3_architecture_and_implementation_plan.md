# Phase 3: Comprehensive Architecture & Implementation Plan

## Architecture Design
- [x] Provide a detailed text description of the high-level architecture diagram
- [x] Design polymorphic interfaces for key components following SOLID principles
- [x] Document how the architecture embodies the Single Responsibility Principle
- [x] Identify and explain implemented GoF design patterns in the architecture
- [x] Create a layered architectural model showing clear separation of concerns
- [x] Recursively document sub-component architectures for complex components
- [x] Design extension points for future enhancements

## Interface & API Design
- [x] Define detailed APIs, interfaces, and abstract classes for polymorphic components
- [x] Create comprehensive data models with validation rules
- [x] Design communication protocols between components
- [x] Document interface contracts and preconditions/postconditions
- [x] Specify error handling and exception propagation strategies
- [x] Use Brave Search MCP to research "[API/library] documentation site:[domain]" for best practices

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Outline recursive implementation steps with increasing specificity:
  - [x] High-level roadmap
  - [x] Component-specific implementation plans 
  - [x] Detailed tasks for each sub-component
- [x] Identify resource needs and potential constraints
- [x] Create a risk mitigation strategy for technical challenges
- [x] Plan for automated testing at all levels
- [x] Consider performance optimization opportunities

## Documentation Plan
- [x] Create comprehensive architecture.md file in this repo with:
  - [x] System overview with justifications for key design decisions
  - [x] Component hierarchy with responsibilities
  - [x] Key interfaces and polymorphic designs
  - [x] Implemented design patterns and their benefits
  - [x] Data flow diagrams
  - [x] Security considerations
  - [x] Performance considerations
  - [x] Future extension plans

## Completed Deliverables
- [x] Created a detailed architecture document with comprehensive component descriptions
- [x] Designed polymorphic interfaces for detection and processing strategies
- [x] Documented implementation of multiple GoF design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Facade, Composite)
- [x] Created clear class diagrams for major system components
- [x] Defined concrete API interfaces with type hints and docstrings
- [x] Outlined detailed implementation strategy with phased approach
- [x] Documented extension points for future enhancements
- [x] Specified integration approach with existing BatchImageProcessor system

(All architecture decisions were based on the specific research findings from Phases 1 and 2, with comprehensive documentation of complex components and their interactions.)
